Hello World GitHub Activity 4.4
I am a student in the OMDS program. After completing an MBA in Business Analytics this December, I am looking forward to gaining more concrete coding and data science knowledge through the OMDS program. I work full time and enjoy crocheting and drawing in my free time.
